# Day02 Notes (README) for Advent of Code 2023

## Solutions
- Part1: 326 (`326`)
- Part2:

### Errors Made
- Taking element property to lgoical operation too soon made code hard to read (compiler solves anyway?)
- unstable map_windows requires special allowance in root, not local file


### Logistics
- Vec<Res<>> ~~> Res<Vec<>> needs cleanear approach

### Had to Lookup
- mapping with slices; Vec<Res<>> inversion
