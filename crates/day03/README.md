## Solutions
- Part1: 184511516 (`184_511_516`)
- Part2: 90044227 (`90_044_227`)

### Methods, General
- regex
- core::split (for literal)

### Errors Made
(pretty simple parsing problem)

### Logistics
- external regex checkers needed (regex101 works well)

### Had to Lookup
- `flat_map()`
- `quickcheck::TestResult` interactions

### Needs
(pretty simple parsing; more complicated parsing would benefit from a tokenizer like `logos`)
