# Day01 Notes (README) for Advent of Code 2023

## Solutions
- Part1: 1722302 (`1_722_302`)
- Part2:

### Errors Made
- Regex pattern took a single digit. (Wasn't immediately noticed when moving from example input.)

### Logistics
- Appending `tracing::` to tracing elements.  Hopefully add something to fold them or otherwise reduce visual noise later.  (And perhaps tag does that some on its own.)
- Simple Regex for parsing.

### Had to Lookup
- `.zip()`
- `.abs_diff()`

### Needs
- Finer trace-log targeting.
- Not landing in template instead of hydrated code when file finding.
